# [executable.graphics](https://executable.graphics/)

A gallery of 4K Executable Graphics artworks from the demoscene.

## Building

Run `./build-site.py` - the site will be built and placed into a `gen/` folder.

The build script requires Python >= 3.9, and depends on the [chevron](https://github.com/noahmorrison/chevron) and [libsass](https://github.com/sass/libsass-python) modules.

In addition, it requires [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/) and [Inkscape >= 1.0](https://inkscape.org/) to be available on the system PATH.

## Contributing

The website is open-source, but it is not open-contribution.

I've made it publicly-visible so that certain trusted individuals can more easily contribute localization, but beyond that I'd largely like to keep the site as it is.

For the sake of my mental health, I'd like to avoid the cognitive overhead of people sending me requests or patches.
